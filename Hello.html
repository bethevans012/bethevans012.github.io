<body>
    <p>This is Stanwood, Washington- the sleepy little town in which I reside! I like to think of it as Washington's best kept secret. It's about an hour north of Seattle and an hour south of the Canadian border. There is plenty to do around Stanwood, like hiking, fishing and beach combing. Or you can walk around the quaint downtown area and check out the many boutiques and antique shops!</p>
